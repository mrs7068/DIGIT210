       A
All my brothers we stand
        G
For the peace of the land

Is there meaning
         A
I've got love in my heart
       G
For an army apart
     D
I am bleeding
       A
All my brothers we stand
        G
For the peace of the land
         D
Is there meaning
         A
I've got love in my heart
       G
For an army apart
     D
I am bleeding

  What the world is made of

  When I'm thinking it's right
