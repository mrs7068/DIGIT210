From the Fires

[Intro]
G#m F#
G#m F# C#
 
 
[Verse 1]
G#m  F#               C#
  Oh mama you lie in ruin
G#m         F#                   C#
  Can't you see what you've done
     G#m F#           C#
Well I've been there before
G#m           F#               C#
  What's this war that you won
G#m  F#                  C#
  Oh mama you walk this way
G#m       F#            C#
  And I'm crying inside
     G#m F#             C#
Well I've been there before
G#m       F#                  C# G#m F# E
  And you know that it's time
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    F#           G#m F#   E
And everybody's talking
        F#              G#m F# E
But you never let them know
    F#               G#m F#   C#
Yes I can hear them talking
 
 
[Chorus]
E         B
  Everyone knows
               F#/C#                  E
That's there's talking on the street
E             B
  Remember the days
             F#/C#             E
When there's no one to defeat
E          B
  Follow me down
       F#/C#                E
To the mountain of the sun
E               B
  Forgetting the end
        F#/C#               E
As your new life has begun
 
 
[Interlude]
G#m F# C# G#m F# C#
 
 
[Verse 2]
G#m    F#                 C#
  Look mama the light is low
G#m       F#            C#
  And the darkness near
    G#m         F#                  C#
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
G#m       F#                    C#
  And the night's what you fear
G#m    F#                   C#
  Walk someone they follow us
G#m          F#         C#
  And you're all undone
    G#m         F#                     C#
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
G#m       F#            C#
  And the war has begun
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G#m F# E
    F#           G#m F#   E
And everybody's talking
        F#            G#m F# E
But you never let em know
    F#               G#m F#   C#
Yes I can hear them talking
 
 
[Chorus]
E         B
  Everyone knows
               F#/C#                   E
That's there's talking on the streets
E             B
  Remember the days
             F#/C#             E
When there's no one to defeat
E          B
  Follow me down
       F#/C#                E
To the mountain of the sun
E               B
  Forgetting the end
        F#/C#               E
As your new life has begun
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G#m F# E    F#           G#m F#   E
       And everybody's talking
        F#              G#m F# E
And you never let them know
    F#               G#m F#   C#
Yes I can hear them talking
 
 
[Chorus]
                       E  B F#/C# E E B F#/C# E
And you never let them know
