[Intro]
A D A D A D A D
 
 
[Verse 1]
A                    D
 She is a lady, comes from all around
A                            D
 She's many places, but she's homeward bound
            A
And now she walks kinda funny
I think she knows
D
Day by day by day
Our love grows
A                   D
 She's a lantern in the night
She's outta sight
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                       D
 Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
A                               D
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma
Hey
 
 
[Chorus]
A
Turn tonight, firelight
D
Star shines in her eye
A                   D
 Makes me feel like I'm alive
                   A
She's outta sight, yeah
D
Aw yeah
        A                             D
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
                         F    G
She's outta sight, outta sight
 
 
[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
A                           D
 Electric gold our love with tender care
A                     D
 Hills of satin grass and maidens fair
        A
Now she rides through the night
On a silver storm
D
Sword in hand
Our fate's torn
A                   D
 She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                       D
 Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
A                               D
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma
Hey
 
 
[Chorus]
A
Turn tonight, firelight
D
Star shines in her eye
A                   D
 Makes me feel like I'm alive
                   A
She's outta sight, yeah
D
Aw yeah
        A                             D
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
                         F    G
She's outta sight, outta sight
 
 
[Solo]

       D A D A      D
Oh yeah       papapa
A D

[Verse 3]
A           G           D
 As the days pass by my mind
A              G
 Are the wrong, the right
       D
You are my sunshine
A                G          D
 And as the night begins to die
A              G                   D
 We are the morning birds that sing against the sky
