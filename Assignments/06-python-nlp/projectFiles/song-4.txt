A Change Is Gonna Come
From the Fires
Greta Van Fleet

[Intro]
F E Am
 
 
[Verse 1]
      C
I was born by the river
In a little tent
Dm
  And just like river, baby
Am
  I've been running ever since
            C
It's been a long
 
 
[Chorus]
          Dm
Long time coming
And I know
Am
  Change is gonna come
 
 
[Verse 2]
          C
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Dm
  Cause I don't know what's up there, baby
Am
  Beyond the sky
            C
It's been a long
 
 
[Chorus]
          Dm
Long time coming
And I know
Am
  Change is gonna come
 
 
[Bridge]
Dm                     C
  Well, I go down to my brother
Dm
  And I say
Brother, help me please,
Am Dm
     But he winds up
Am
Knocking me back down
Dm
  On my knees
 
 
[Verse 3]
G             C
 There'd been times where I thought I
Couldn't last for long
Dm
  Now I think I'm able
Am
  To carry on
            C
It's been a long
 
 
[Chorus]
          Dm
Long time coming
And I know
Am
  Change is gonna come
C
 Oh, yes it will
It's been a long
          Dm
Long time coming
And I know
Am                 C
  Change gonna come
Well, it's been a long
          Dm           F   E
Long time coming And I know
 
 
[Outro]
Am F E Am F E Am F E Am F E
Am F E Am F E Am F E Am
