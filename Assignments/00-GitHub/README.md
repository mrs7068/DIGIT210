# GitHub Assignments

*This directory is where I will store the various GitHub assignments for DIGIT 210.*

The first assignment requires a text file in a logical nested directory. I chose to create a markdown README file A) so this description shows up pretty in GitHub, and B) so I could practice creating a markdown file in MacDown.
